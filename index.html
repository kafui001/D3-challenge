          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>When reviewing the data, one can choose either the poverty rate or the median household income on the 
            x-axis to begin.  These two metrics are, not surprisingly, very well inversely coorelated.  In
            other words, states with high poverty levels have a lower median income and those with low poverty levels
            have high median incomes. States do tend to cluster around the $40,000 - $55,000 median income range, so
            lookin at the poverty rate might be more instructional to start</p>

          <p>One clear trend in the data is when the poverty level increases so too does the rate of smoking and obesity,
             as well as lack of healthcare.  States that have the lowest poverty levels all trend to be in the New England
             area, whereas the highest poverty levels appear to be in the South.  Mississippi really stands out as a state
             with high the highest poverty level and high levels of obesity, smokers and a lack of healthcare.
             Texas has the highest percentage of people without healthcare, but the state also has close to the national
             average in percentage of smokers and obesity levels.</p>

          <p>A interesting discovery was the average age of states.  Common assumptions are that warmer states tend to have
            older populations (retirement communities).  However, three of the oldest states were all in the Northeast: ME, NH, VT.
            There is no clear trend when correlating age and healthcare, obesity levels or smokers.  Utah has the youngest state
            by far, and clearly the population doesn't smoke.
          </p>

          <p>In conclusion, while this dataset does show us the relationships between financial conditions of a given state
            and the health of the state, it would be interesting to see how the health metrics correlate within a given state.
            In other words, does a state with high obesity levels also have a high percentage of smokers? Or does the smoking
            population tend to have more or less healthcare coverage?
